### How We Decide Which Tickers to Trade <a href="#how-we-decide-which-tickers-to-trade" id="how-we-decide-which-tickers-to-trade"></a>

_**There are a lot of tickers coming out, probably every hour. How do you decide which ones to jump in?**_

_**Our Four AI Screeners**_

1. _**📰 Live-News Signals**_
   * _**Tracks real-time news impacting stocks and options.**_
   * _**Helps identify tickers with immediate catalysts or major announcements.**_
2. _**🤖 Live-Unusual-Options**_
   * _**Monitors unusual options activity across the market.**_
   * _**Highlights potential plays based on large or unexpected options trades.**_
3. _**💥 Live-Small-Options**_
   * _**Focuses on smaller contracts and emerging tickers with high momentum.**_
   * _**Useful for spotting early-stage moves before large-volume traders enter.**_
4.  _**🎲 Live-WSB Signals**_

    * _**Tracks social sentiment from platforms like WallStreetBets.**_
    * _**Identifies tickers with potential retail-driven volatility and rapid price action.**_

    ​

    _**Key Takeaway**_

    * _We **don’t jump on every ticker** — we let the screeners filter opportunities._
    * _This approach ensures we **focus on high-probability plays** backed by data, news, or unusual market activity._
    * _Combining these screeners helps balance **safety, momentum, and potential upside**, allowing us to act efficiently in real time._
