# What is QS V3 ?

_<mark style="background-color:green;">**Meet Katy — the brain of QS V3**</mark>_

_At the core of V3 is Katy, QS’s proprietary TSFM (Time Series Foundational Model)._\
_Like how an LLM understands human language, TSFM understands the language of markets — bars, candles, price actions. It uses tokenization + transformer + deep training on massive data to predict what comes next, not just what already happened._

* <sup>_📖_</sup>_&#x20;Reference: Google’s research on TSFM_\

* _Traditional indicators only read history. Katy reads the future. That’s why QS V3’s kline predictions feel sharply accurate — it’s the world’s first “market language model._

_<mark style="background-color:green;">**2️⃣ Why We Pair Katy (TSFM) with QS AI (LLM)**</mark>_

* _Katy is brilliant with numbers — but she only “speaks” data._\
  _If breaking news, earnings, or macro events hit the market, she won’t see them immediately._
* _That’s why we pair her with QS AI, our large language model that reads news, filings, social sentiment, and macro data._
