* **Goal**: Capture fast intraday moves with precise entries and exits

**SPY** = A fund you can buy like a stock that follows the S\&P 500. Each share is a small piece of the 500 biggest U.S. companies. Easy to trade and very popular.

**SPX** = The S\&P 500 index itself. You can‚Äôt buy it directly, but you can trade options based on it.

üëâ **Easy way to remember:**

* **SPY = stock version of the index**
* **SPX = the index itself**
* **The important thing is:** _SPX options are about 10√ó bigger than SPY, so they‚Äôre better if you have a larger account or higher risk appetite._
